#### Week 1

##### Lecture 1 Better Software

这门课讨论的就是如何让软件项目执行地更好！

一个典型的软件开发团队通常包括

```
Codeing muscle
Graphic designers
testing personnel
```

客户要参与软件开发，但是并不属于开发团队

1. 两个关键因素`人员 & 过程管理` **_people & process_**

软件过程管理的任务

```
与客户的交互  Interacting with clients
管理和跟踪开发  Manageing and tracking development
与项目开发团队的合作  Collaborating with the development team
确保产品质量  Ensuring product quality
```

2. 去理解实现更好的软件的观点（三个）

```
provide the right software product for the clients
have the software product done right
have the project for the product managed right
```

`Ritght Product` : 理解用户

- 明确他们的需要（elicit their `needs`)
- 表达软件需求（express software `requirments`)

`Done right`

- the software comforms to a specific design 软件符合特定的设计
- the design satisfies the states set of requirements 设计满足状态集的要求

`managed right`

- to organize the work of everyone involved.组织所有相关人员的工作。
- to insure that the other view points are met.以确保满足前面两个观点。

**_A software product manager take a central role in these activities_**

##### Lecture 2 Why Software Product Management

- to take control of projects from the very beginning
- to manage projects efficiently and collaboratively

##### Lecture 3 The Role of a Software Product Manager

A producer and a director for a movie！

- Multiple disciplines
  Great software product managers have mastered multiple disciplines.
  - They can speak to both clients and developers in their terms.
  - They can listen and imagine a client’s vision, communicate effectively with their development team members, and motivate the team to achieve the best outcomes.
  - They can also manage clients’ expectations, and they also know how to get the best efforts out of their development team.
  - They care about their people.

* Teamwork

  - Success of your product also depends on solid teamwork of {programmers + testers + interface designers + graphic artists}, must work together.
  - Your role is to empower them to bring their best efforts to your project. Software product management is a leadership role.

Interviews on the leadership role of software product management

- understanding the product
- the value that this project will have for the client
- speak to both clients and developers in their terms
  - listen and imagine a client’s vision
  - communicate effectively with development team members, and motivate the team to achieve the best outcomes
  - Care about their people

#### Week 2

##### Lecture 1 Project Success - Why Agile

Agile Practices

- Guidelines that suggest how software development should occur to get the best results.
- Agile covers a large part of what a product manager do.

  1. Choose the factor or factors that you think are most representative of a successful project
     on schedule -> meets requirements -> on budget
     时间的重要性，时间没有卡在对的时间上就会丢失市场

  2. What factor do you think is the most important for having a successful project?
     timing-> a talented development team -> a good idea -> a business model -> funding

##### Lecture 2 Agile Manifesto

1. What is Agile?
   some guiding principles that can improve the success of projects  
   敏捷，是一些让项目更成功的指导原则

2. Important factors in software development 敏捷宣言的核心价值观
   Four core value statements of Agile

- Individuals and interactions » processes and tools
- Working software » comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration » contract negotiation（合同变更）
- Responding to change » following a plan
